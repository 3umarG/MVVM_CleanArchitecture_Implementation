## Advantages of MVVM Pattern:
   - Enhance the reusability of code.
   - All modules are independent which improves the testability of each layer.
   - Makes project files maintainable and easy to make changes.

## Disadvantages of MVVM Pattern:
   - This design pattern is not ideal for small projects.
   - If the data binding logic is too complex, the application debug will be a little harder.
